Welcome!

I'm a cool human being. You can refer to me as he/him. My first name is actually `Pierre-Paul` (_pee-ai-r-eh peh-l_), not `Pierre`. You don't really need to remember my last name, Pierre-Paul is more than enough.

I like python, but I've worked a lot with PHP in the past. I'm also a very curious person, rust is very tempting at the moment, but I'm short on time.

Feel free to browser my profile or e-mail me. Always open to a coffee chat.
