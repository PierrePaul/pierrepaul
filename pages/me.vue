      <p>I started off as a web developer, following CEGEP, where I studied "informatique de gestion" and then one year at the ETS. After my two first years as a professional web developer, I started getting really interested in system administration. This attraction helped me get a better understanding of the low level packages that would be used later on to deliver faster, more responsive web applications.</p>
      <p>From June 2013 to November 2016, I've been the main Sysadmin at Pheromone, managing a not so small cluster of servers. Some being VMWare, others being OpenVZ contexts while others were Amazon EC2.</p>
      <p>From November 2016 to May 2018, I was promoted CTO to a new Pheromone subentity named StudioQi, focused on creating games.</p>
      <p>From August 2018 up to 2020, I have been working with Francois Viens on multiple (and very cool contracts), like Dis-Moi or TradeSpecifix.</p>
      <p>In 2020, with Edouard and Francois, we decided to create a new company, called FIXRS, where developers no longer need to choose between family and work.</p>
