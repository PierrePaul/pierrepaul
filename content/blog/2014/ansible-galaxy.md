I'm doing a lightning talk next Monday on [ansible-galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/). It can be compared to the puppet forge but for ansible. Users rate each "roles". Every role is published on github and can be forked, read and you can, of course, submit new issues to it. The site uses oauth from Google, Twitter and Facebook, but you can also create an account the good ol' way as well.

It's a nice way to understand how some more complex applications are installed. More and more, I feel like applications need the installation of many complex middleware (which is good) and we are finally seeing developers moving away from "better remake my own because the open-source one does things a little bit different that what I want". Ansible recipes (or Chef or Puppet recipes) are a good way to understand how theses middleware are expected to interact with each others.

I don't want to spoil too much of my talk on Monday, so make sure to register to the [event](http://register.devopsmtl.com/). Free food and drinks will be provided, thanks for the sponsor [FlightHub](http://www.flighthub.com).

Here is a listing of all the talk for the night : [DevOpsMtl](http://www.devopsmtl.com/2014/01/28/devopsmtl-freezing-edition-documenting-your-infrastructure/).
