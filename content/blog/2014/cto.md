You're not the only one suprised, believe me. I think I have been good at juggling everything I had on my hands, technology wise at least, but I never expected this to happen.

I had expected a lot of things, really, but not being promoted to CTO at StudioQI. I have been working at Pheromone/StudioQI for a little bit than 2.5 years and enjoyed all of it. There has been up and downs, big changes along the way, but it was always for the better.

I have been working a lot to move all the projects and the process internally to something closer to real devops. I always has been focused on this objective, as this was my task and I truly believe it was the right thing to do. Valentin Backofen (previous CTO, now CEO, congrats!) trusted me to get this forward and move the team into a more rapid and agile environment.

It was a great experience to work with the trust of your peers and see result happen and I can't thank Valentin enough for this. Valentin has been a great leader for the tech team and I am sure will continue to be for the whole company. He didn't always had it easy either, but he did wonderfully well.

So from now on I will be acting as CTO of StudioQI. I know I have a lot of work to do, both personal and for StudioQI, but we will all get there. I have a very strong technology background, but I can be very bad at personal interactions. Bear with me while I learn and together we will build something even more awesome.
