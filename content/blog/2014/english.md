For quite some time now, I've been thinking about creating an english blog. As some of you might be aware, I'm already not very active on the french one, so it didn't make much sense to create yet another site. Even though sometimes I think I prefer creating the site than writing on it ;). I'm an avid reader of [Frédéric Harper](http://outofcomfortzone.net)'s blog.

So, from now on, there will a mix of french and english content on this blog and hopefully more regular content. As a side effect, my english writing should improve as well.
