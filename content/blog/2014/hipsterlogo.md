Summary: Let's create a hipster logo.

A long time ago I stumbled on a [poster online](http://hipsterlogo.com/) that describes how to create a "hipster logo". Which are basically used by startup to distinguish themselves by using the same templates over and over (doesn't make sense? It's not supposed to). Now I actually found a [web application](http://hipsterlogogenerator.com/) to make it even easier.

Give it a try, but keep in mind that your *creations* are saved and shown to everyone afterward.
