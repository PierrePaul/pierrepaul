Summary: I'm going to PyCon 2014 in Montreal. Let's try to pinpoint the most interesting sessions and build up my own schedule and try to guide you through some sessions of the schedule.

For the first time (I think?) and for the following year PyCon US will be held in Canada, Montreal. Working in Montreal and loving Python, I had to sign up and was really surprised to see the low price of it. Big "Con" like this one usually runs up at around 700$USD, but the early bird rate (for individual) was 200$USD. Being so accessible, I had to sign up.

So here we are, a few months later, and a [full schedule has been published](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/talks/). Here are some of my picks for the first day:

# Character encoding and Unicode in Python: How to (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ with dignity - Friday 10:50 a.m.–11:20 a.m.

[Session information](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/168/)

Aside from being a good unicode test for pelican, [the blog engine] I'm using(http://blog.getpelican.com/), it's also an issue I had way too many times in the past. I usually deal with Python to create command line applications. Being a DevOps, it only makes sense to automate all the time everything I do and Python is great language to do it. For some reason, I always end up with encoding errors, either for console output or input and messes something up. Python3 made a lot of deep changes to UTF-8/Unicode handling and I hope this (pretty quick session) talks at least a bit about it. I think I'm expecting a lot for a 30minutes session... ☺


# Cache me if you can: memcached, caching patterns and best practices - Friday 11:30 a.m.–noon

[Session information](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/173/)

I'm already used to memcached, from a PHP perspective, but this talk should also be about _how_ memcached works. I really never took the time to understand how memcached worked. To me, it just worked and was blazingly fast. This talk should also be about some usage patterns in Python which should be also very interesting.

# Kneel And Disconnect: Getting The Fastest Connection Out Of A Hostname - Friday 11:30 a.m.–noon

[Session information](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/156/)

Yes, it's at the same time as the other one and I'm not sure which one I will attend.

This talk is roughly about DNS and [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) which I have never touched but it always seemed very nice. This talk is _also_ about the developer experience to contribute to such a big project and learn proper Python testing tools along the way.

# By Your Bootstraps: Porting Your Application to Python3 - Friday 12:10 p.m.–12:55 p.m.

[Session information](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/157/)

With Python 3.4 out the door, most people claim it will be finally the year that python3 takes over python2.7. Talk like this one should be a must to attend to. This talk should talk a lot about Zope3, ZODB, WebOb and Pyramid, which again, I have no expertise in. Conferences are made so you learn new things right?

# Ansible - Python-Powered Radically Simple IT Automation - Friday 1:40 p.m.–2:25 p.m.

[Session information](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/152/)

I've been a big fan of Ansible for a few months now and this talk is given by [Michael DeHaan](https://us.pycon.org/2014/speaker/profile/177/), the creator of Ansible. When I saw the name, I didn't even look at the other sessions going at the same time. This talk is also listed as *Intermediate*, so I have really high hopes for this one!

# Twisted Mixing - Friday 2:35 p.m.–3:05 p.m.

[Session information](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/138/)

I already mentioned my lack of knowledge for Twisted and this session should be a very intense kick start for it, along gevent.

# What Is Async, How Does It Work, And When Should I Use It? - Friday 3:15 p.m.–4 p.m.

[Session information](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/284/)

If my brain is not burned at this point, I might as well get a real introduction to Twisted, Tornado and Tulip(?). I'm sure the previous session will left me with awfully lots of questions, so this one will be more than welcome.

# Castle Anthrax: Dungeon Generation Techniques - Friday 4:30 p.m.–5 p.m.

[Session information](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/146/)

If my brain is really burned out, I might make the best out of it. This session should be light weight, fun and be a nice closing for this long first day.

# The State of Crypto in Python

[Session information](https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/202/)

Just in case I don't want something fun and light, why not close the day with cryptography instead? This talk should go over the main 3 *frameworks* and highlight their weaknesses and their good sides. This should be a nice talk, given by two very highly qualified employees from Rackspace.


# Conclusion

I really wanted to lay out my whole schedule, but there is way too much research to put it all into only in one post. Every session should deserve even more research and exposure than I did, but hopefully, as a reader, you will take time to investigate those as well.
