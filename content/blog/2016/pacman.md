[Stumbled on this](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html), via Hacker News. It's a pacman little game. You have to use different algorithms to build the best path to get all the food.
The game calculates a score for each algorithm you provide, so no need to send your code to anyone and wait for feedback, it's instant and private.

If like me, you know nothing about this, but would like to know more, I found this excellent free [Youtube playlist from MIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb). You can skip directly to video 13/14 if you wanna work directly on the first question of the pacman puzzle.

Have fun!
